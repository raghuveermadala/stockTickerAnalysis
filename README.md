### Disclaimer
The scrapers are at the mercy of the respective financial websites as they may update their
style sheets, layout, or even place the desired information behind pay-walls; they are bound
to break eventually. This project will try to keep the scrapers up-to-date but no guarantees.

**Use at your own risk!*** This project or its contributors are not responsible for any abuse or
violations of Terms of Service with any financial websites.
